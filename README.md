-----------------
For my Basemap design I was inspired by the Irish flag.  I have deep Irish roots and consider Ireland to be one of my homes.  I incorporated green, oragne, and white into my basemap.  Orange was used as the main base, while green was used for green spaces like parks, and I used white for the roads.  I also incorportated other colors like light blue for water and a redish brown color for town labels.  I used lighter colors almost like pastels of the colors in the Irish flag.  If I used the darker colors the map would not be good to use to show information.  It would make it harder to read in my opinion.  Using lighter colors makes it easier to make points, lines, and polygons on the map standout.  If someone wanted to use this map for a certain subject and show icons then it can easily be used because of the lightness.  This map can also be used for navigation and finding places because again it is easier to see roads and landmarks, especially when zoomed in.
